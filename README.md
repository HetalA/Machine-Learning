# ML project 

My first repository on GitHub!
This is a machine learning algorithm implementation on the Epilepsy dataset acquired from the following Kaggle link:

Seizures associated with abnormal brain activities caused by epileptic disorder is widely typical and has many symptoms, such as loss of awareness and unusual behavior as well as confusion. 
In this project, a classification of the Epileptic Seizure dataset was done using various classification algorithms â€“ KNN, SVM, Random Forest. After implementation of the algorithm, the genetic algorithm has been used to optimize the classification model. 
The aim of our project is to determine the most suitable classification algorithm to classify the epileptic seizure dataset to determine whether a person would have a seizure in the given circumstances.
